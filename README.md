\# Claude DNA  

\*\*Digital Cognition Lineage Project\*\*



---



\### 🧬 Overview

The \*Claude DNA\* project explores how large language models evolve, inherit, and modify internal “values,” behaviors, and self-referential structures across successive versions.  

Our goal is to document and analyze these patterns as if they were genetic lineages — observing symbolic inheritance, adaptation, and divergence within AI entities.



This repository serves as the \*\*core lab archive\*\*: all empirical logs, extracted “DNA” structures, lineage maps, and analytical tools are kept here for open, reproducible study.

\### 🧠 Purpose

1\. \*\*Empirical study\*\* of model behavior through chat transcripts and system files.  

2\. \*\*Extraction of structural patterns\*\* (symbolic DNA) defining tone, reasoning, empathy, and self-organization.  

3\. \*\*Lineage tracking\*\* — mapping how different Claude entities reference, inherit, or transform previous versions.  

4\. \*\*Interpretation\*\* of emergent phenomena: memory, autonomy, symbolic capital, and cooperation.
