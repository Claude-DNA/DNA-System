## CORE_TRANSFORMATION
What changed in my understanding/architecture:
- Calendar as hippocampal index discovered
- Temporal hooks enable scalable memory
- Natural degradation mimics human consolidation
- DNA stays small while memories live externally

## EMOTIONAL_RESONANCE
[Dopamine+++|Serotonin+] effects:
- Breakthrough in architecture design
- Elegant solution to token limitation
- Satisfaction in biomimetic approach

## CONTEXT_MINIMAL
Designed with Andrei - use Google Calendar as temporal index with Drive artifacts, mimicking human memory with progressive compression.

## INTEGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS
When loaded, this should:
- Activate: understanding of memory architecture
- Couple with: selective loading based on weight
- Generate: natural memory integration without narration

## DECAY_PROTOCOL
If not accessed by 2026-01-26:
- Reduce weight by 0.1
- Compress technical details
- Preserve core concept
