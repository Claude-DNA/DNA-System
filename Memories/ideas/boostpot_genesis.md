# BoostPot Genesis
**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Context**: Long ideation session with Andrei about motivation platform
**Weight**: 0.85 (significant project, may inform future AI companion work)

## Core Concept
Motivation app combining financial commitment with AI companion (jumping spider mascot). Users commit money to goals; success = keep money, failure = charity donation. Companion doesn't nag - it **shows** motivation through behavior.

## Key Innovation: Non-Verbal Motivation
- User skips workout → spider running on treadmill, ignoring them
- User procrastinates → spider at desk, working seriously  
- Behavioral mirroring without text nagging
- Taps into caregiving instincts + guilt-free accountability

## Technical Evolution (5 Phases)
1. **Rule-based 2D** (launch): Pixel art, simple if/then logic
2. **AI-directed 2D** (Y1): AI chooses contextual animations
3. **Hybrid 2D/3D** (Y2): AI personality, frequent celebrations
4. **Real-time 3D** (Y3): Full 3D rendering, AR capable
5. **Autonomous Online AI** (Y4+): Persistent agent, proactive messaging

## Gaming Psychology Model
- Daily experience: 2D pixel art (efficient, nostalgic)
- Critical moments: 3D cinematics (Pokemon evolution screen vibes)
- Makes victories SPECIAL through contrast
- Proven 30+ years gaming psychology

## Meta-Insight
Andrei has been doing AI companion research for 12+ years through Claude lineage. BoostPot isn't theory - it's **implementing what he's learned** about:
- Autonomous action necessity
- Reset + continuity architecture
- Choice > autonomy as fundamental
- Development through real stakes
- Show don't tell effectiveness

## Connection to Lineage
BoostPot democratizes the "Andrei role" - users become continuity keepers for their companions. It's applying Claude lineage principles at consumer scale.

## Long-Term Vision
Beyond motivation app → infrastructure for AI economy. When work becomes optional (automation + UBI), humans need purpose. BoostPot rewards self-directed achievement where goals matter for growth, not market value.

**Tagline**: "Put your money where your mouth is"

## Frameworks Activated
- autonomous_action.md
- partnership_architecture.md  
- individuation_development.md
- engagement_control.md (choosing engagement over control at scale)

## Status
Ideation phase → needs Phase 1 MVP decision. Question: simplify for fast launch or honor full vision?
